# API
## Students
A student record MAY consist of the following fields:
```javascript
{
    "id": Number,
    "name": String,
    "class_letter": String,
    "graduation_year": Number,
    "lent_books": Array,
    "base_sets": Array
}
```
which will always be included in a response. It MUST consist of the
following fields:
```javascript
{
    "name": String,
    "class_letter": String,
    "graduation_year": Number
}
```
`lent_books` and `base_sets` will only be non-null in a response, if they are
specifically asked for (`include=â€¦`). Both fields' items are arrays whose first
item is the date when the book was lent and whose second item is the respective
[Book](#books) record.
