# API
## Students
A student record MAY consist of the following fields:
```javascript
{
    id: Number,
    name: String,
    class_letter: String,
    graduation_year: Number,
    lent_books: Array,
    base_sets: Array
}
```
which will always be included in a response. It MUST consist of the
following fields:
```javascript
{
    name: String,
    class_letter: String,
    graduation_year: Number
}
```
`lent_books` and `base_sets` will only be non-null in a response, if they are
specifically asked for (`include=â€¦`). Both fields' items are arrays whose first
item is the date when the book was lent (always in UTC-time) and whose
second item is the respective [Book](#books) record.

Note that a client-supplied `id` will always be ignored (aside from the route)

## Books
A book record MAY consist of the following entries:
```javascript
{
    id: Number,
    isbn: String,
    title: String,
    form: String,
    aliases: Array
}
```
where `form` is a comma-separated list of forms (Jahrgangsstufen) to which the
book in question is usually distributed, and `aliases` is an array of alias records.
A server response will always look this way. The user usually only has to specify
the following fields:
```javascript
{
    isbn: String,
    title: String,
    forms: String
}
```
the rest will be `None`'d automatically.

Note that a client-supplied `id` will always be ignored (aside from the route).
